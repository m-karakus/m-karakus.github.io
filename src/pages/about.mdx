    <p>
      I’m a <strong>Data Professional</strong> working on data engineering
      and analytics platforms, with a strong focus on designing
      <strong> scalable, maintainable, and long-term sustainable modern data architectures</strong>.
    </p>

I’ve worked with companies in <strong>finance, telecom, and large-scale enterprise environments</strong>,
where regulatory constraints, security requirements, and operational reliability are critical.
I have hands-on experience building and operating
<strong> production-grade data systems</strong> under real-world constraints.

## **What I Work On**

I usually create value across the following areas:

* 🏗 **Modern Data Platforms**
  * Snowflake, ClickHouse, BigQuery
  * dbt, Dagster, Airflow, AWS Glue  
  
* 🔄 **Data Pipelines & Streaming**
  * Kafka, Debezium, Spark, PySpark
  * PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CDC-based architectures  

* ☁️ **Cloud & Kubernetes**
  * AWS & Azure
  * Kubernetes-native deployments, GitOps (Argo CD)

* 📊 **Analytics & BI**
  * Power BI, Tableau
  * Semantic layers and self-service analytics

## **Why This Site Exists**

This site is my personal <strong>knowledge base</strong>, where I share what I’ve learned through real projects:

* based on <strong>production experience</strong>, not theory
* without turning everything into “tool X vs tool Y” debates
* focusing on <strong>why a certain decision was made</strong>, not just <em>what</em> was built

Here you’ll find:

* architectural decision records (ADR),
* production learnings and post-mortems,
* tool and approach comparisons,
* and occasional “things I wish I knew earlier” notes.

---

## **My Approach**

> Tools change. **Good architecture lasts.**

* I prefer simple and understandable solutions
* I actively avoid over-engineering
* I focus on making systems <strong>clear first</strong>, then <strong>scalable and robust</strong>

## **Let’s Connect**

If you’d like to discuss data platforms, architecture decisions, or real-world trade-offs,
